Logotype KA HMK has been renamed to and is now called Logotype KB HMK.This font was previously updated on 6-25-96 to include the Expressions From Hallmark logo. The name was not changed on this earlier version in order to preserve the font calls in existing formats.However, when in actual use, this solution did not work well and created many problems. In order to solve this dilemma the "Logotype KA" version has now been updated to "Logotype KB".It will be necessary to update the font calls in any formats that are in current use. We are sorry about the resulting confusion and inconvenience.The addition of Expressions from HMK was the only change made to these fonts. The Expressions From Hallmark logo may be found by using the "Shift X" keystroke.Font ID conflicts will occur if the user attempts to have both the old and new version accessed at the same time.7-29-96.

READ ME USE GUIDELINESLOGO 1Logo 1 is to be used for special processes such as Flexography, Hot Foil Stamping, Embossing and Silk-Screening. To accommodate these processes, the dots on the Crown are larger, and more space has been given between the logo typeface and the oval rim of the crown. This logo should not be used above 48 pt.LOGO 2Logo 2 is considered the standard logo and is to be used as the primary logo within the corporation.LOGO 3Logo 3 was developed for use on the corporation's business cards, letterheads and envelopes. In this version, the logo typeface and crown have been modified to give a lighter, more delicate appearance. Logo 3 is also optional for use when a size larger than 84 pt. is needed. This version retains the elegance and character of the logo in larger applications.11-13-2000

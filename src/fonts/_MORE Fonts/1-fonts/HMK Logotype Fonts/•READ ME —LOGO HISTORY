AMB logo added to the fonts.  Font exceeds 1000 unit bounding box as did the original; bounding box max metrics will vary slightly between the three versions.3-25-91 versions; Logotype One KA Ñ large ball crown version for process & small size use; AMB logo let spaced Logotype Two KA Ñ small ball crown version for normal useLogotype Three KA Ñ small ball crown, lightened HMK, version for stationary & large size usebitmap or screen ids; 13050, 13051, 13052  outline or printer ids; 4013050, 4013051, 40130523-16-93 versionMyron added Continious Improvement logo 3-16-93 to all three versions; fonts reissued with no name/version or id changes.  Name and ids were left unchanged in order to protect font calls in active job formats.6-25-96 versionMyron added Expressions From Hallmark logo 6-25-96 to all three versions; fonts reissued with no name/version or id changes.  Name and ids were left unchanged in order to protect font calls in active job formats.7-29-96 versionMyron changed the name/version and the outline id to resolve outline id problem. Outline fonts are stored in printer cache memory (also HD memory on some devices) on output devices by the outline id number.  The bitmap id remained unchanged (to encourage users to purge their systems of any older versions, the  methodology currently used on all HMK fonts).  The Name/Version change requires a new font call on older jobs or simultaneous loading of multiple versions requiring a  renumbering of bitmap ids.7-29-96 versions; Logotype One KB Logotype Two KBLogotype Three KBbitmap or screen ids; 13050, 13051, 13052; unchanged  outline or printer ids; 4113050, 4113051, 4113052; changed 11/13/2000 versionsLogotype One PKALogotype Two PKALogotype Three PKAA corporate decision was made to redesign the Hallmark logotype.
